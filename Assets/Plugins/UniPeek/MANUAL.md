# UniPeek — User Manual

Stream your Unity Game View live to your iOS or Android phone over Wi-Fi.

---

## What You Need

- A phone with the **UniPeek** companion app installed (iOS or Android)
- Both your PC/Mac and phone on the **same Wi-Fi network**
- Unity 2021.3 or newer

---

## Opening the UniPeek Window

Go to **Window → UniPeek** in the Unity menu bar.

The UniPeek window can be docked anywhere in your editor layout like any other Unity panel.

---

## Connecting Your Phone

### Option 1 — QR Code (easiest)

1. Click **Start Streaming** in the UniPeek window.
2. A QR code appears in the window.
3. Open the UniPeek app on your phone and tap **Scan QR**.
4. Point the camera at the QR code.
5. The dot in the window turns green — you are connected.

### Option 2 — Auto-Discovery (mDNS)

UniPeek broadcasts its presence on the local network automatically.
In the UniPeek app, tap **Browse** and your machine name will appear in the list. Tap it to connect.

No QR code needed. Both devices must be on the same subnet.

### Option 3 — Reverse Connection (Android) — Under development

> This feature is currently under development and may not work in all builds.

Use this when your phone cannot reach your PC (hotel Wi-Fi, corporate network with client isolation).

1. In the UniPeek app, switch to **Listen** mode.
2. In Unity, click **Start Streaming**, then expand the **Reverse Connection** section.
3. Enter your phone's IP address and click **Connect to Phone**.
4. The editor dials out to the phone on port **7778**.

### Option 4 — USB / ADB (Android only) — Coming soon

Automatic ADB port forwarding is not yet built into the plugin. As a workaround, run the following command manually after connecting via USB, then connect the app to `localhost`:

```sh
adb reverse tcp:7777 tcp:7777
```

| Area | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Status dot | Grey = stopped, Amber = waiting for phone, Green = connected |
| **Start / Stop Streaming** button | Starts or stops the stream |
| QR code | Appears while waiting; disappears once connected |
| Stats bar | Shows live FPS and encode time (WebRTC mode shows RTT instead) |
| **Options** section | Editor name, socket mode, play mode behaviour, capture method, log level |
| **Connected Devices** list | Shows all currently connected phones |
| **Reverse Connection** panel | Manual outbound connection to a phone in Listen mode |
| **Docs** button | Opens this manual online |
| **Reset FW** button | Re-runs Windows Firewall setup if connections are failing |
| **Port** field | Configurable listen port (default 7777); editable only when not streaming |

---

## Options

### Editor Name

Sets the display name shown in the UniPeek app's device list. Defaults to your machine name.
Type a name and click **Set** to save it.

### Socket Mode

Selects the streaming transport:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **WebSocket** | JPEG frames sent as binary WebSocket messages. Works on all setups. |
| **WebRTC** | Low-latency peer-to-peer video. Requires `com.unity.webrtc` ≥ 3.0.0 in your project. |

The WebRTC option only appears if the `com.unity.webrtc` package is installed.

### Run in Play Mode

When **on**: streaming only runs while the Editor is in Play Mode. Entering Edit Mode automatically stops streaming.

When **off**: streaming runs all the time, even in Edit Mode. The stream will briefly drop when scripts recompile (domain reload). Useful for inspecting the editor camera without entering Play.

### Capture Method

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Camera Render** | Renders the main camera synchronously. Works in Edit and Play Mode. |
| **Async GPU Readback** | Same render path but non-blocking — reduces CPU stall at the cost of ~1 frame of extra latency. |

Switch between them at any time; the change takes effect on the next captured frame.

### Log Level

Controls how much UniPeek writes to the Unity Console:

| Level | Output |
| --- | --- |
| **None** | Completely silent |
| **Error** | Errors only |
| **Warning** | Errors and warnings |
| **All** | Full diagnostic output |

---

## Touch Input

UniPeek injects touch into **every active input backend** simultaneously:

| Backend | How it works | Reliability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **New Input System** (`com.unity.inputsystem`) | Virtual `Touchscreen` device via `InputSystem.QueueStateEvent` | Fully supported |
| **Legacy Input Manager** | Internal `Input.SimulateTouch(Touch)` via reflection | Best-effort — works on Unity 2021 – 2022 – 6; may break on future versions |

The active backend is controlled by **Edit → Project Settings → Player → Active Input Handling**:

- **Input System Package (New)** — only the new Input System path runs.
- **Input Manager (Old)** — only the Legacy reflection path runs.
- **Both** — UniPeek injects into both systems at the same time. This is the recommended setting when your project uses a mix of old and new Input APIs.

UniPeek delivers touches through two additional channels regardless of backend:

| Channel | Class / API |
| --- | --- |
| **UniPeekInput events** | `UniPeekInput.OnTouch` / `OnTouchDetailed` |
| **Unity Input System polling** | `ETouch.activeTouches`, `Touchscreen.current`, etc. (requires new Input System) |

Touch overlays (semi-transparent circles) are drawn on the Game View automatically while touches are active.

> **Multi-touch, gyroscope, and accelerometer** are **Pro** features. Free tier receives single touch only.

### UniPeekInput

`UniPeekInput` is a lightweight static event bus. UniPeek fires its events on the main thread for every touch that arrives from the phone.

```csharp
using UniPeek;
using UnityEngine;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    void OnEnable()  => UniPeekInput.OnTouch += HandleTouch;
    void OnDisable() => UniPeekInput.OnTouch -= HandleTouch;

    void HandleTouch(Vector2 normalizedPos)
    {
        // normalizedPos.x : 0 = left edge,  1 = right edge
        // normalizedPos.y : 0 = top edge,   1 = bottom edge
        float screenX = normalizedPos.x * Screen.width;
        float screenY = (1f - normalizedPos.y) * Screen.height; // flip Y for Unity screen space
        Debug.Log($"Touch at screen ({screenX}, {screenY})");
    }
}
```

#### OnTouchDetailed

Use this when you need the finger ID or phase string:

```csharp
UniPeekInput.OnTouchDetailed += (fingerId, phase, normalizedPos) =>
{
    // phase: "began" | "moved" | "ended" | "canceled"
    Debug.Log($"Finger {fingerId} {phase} at {normalizedPos}");
};
```

#### When to use UniPeekInput

- You want a simple callback without dealing with the Input System device layer.
- You need to react to individual touch events (e.g. "tap began") rather than polling state every frame.

### New Input System integration

When `com.unity.inputsystem` is installed, UniPeek automatically injects all touches into a virtual `Touchscreen` device. You can read them using any standard Input System API.

#### Single touch — polling

```csharp
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

var ts = Touchscreen.current;
if (ts != null && ts.primaryTouch.press.isPressed)
{
    Vector2 pos = ts.primaryTouch.position.ReadValue();
}
```

#### Multi-touch — Enhanced Touch

Enable `EnhancedTouchSupport` once (e.g. in `OnEnable`) then read `ETouch.activeTouches` every frame:

```csharp
using UnityEngine.InputSystem.EnhancedTouch;
using ETouch = UnityEngine.InputSystem.EnhancedTouch.Touch;

void OnEnable()  => EnhancedTouchSupport.Enable();
void OnDisable() => EnhancedTouchSupport.Disable();

void Update()
{
    var touches = ETouch.activeTouches;

    // Filter out Ended/Canceled — they linger for one frame after lift
    int live = 0;
    foreach (var t in touches)
    {
        if (t.phase == UnityEngine.InputSystem.TouchPhase.Ended ||
            t.phase == UnityEngine.InputSystem.TouchPhase.Canceled) continue;
        live++;
    }
}
```

> **Important:** Always filter out `Ended` and `Canceled` phases when counting active fingers.
> Enhanced Touch keeps a lifted touch in `activeTouches` for one frame after it ends,
> which can cause spurious multi-touch events if you only check `Count`.

#### Coordinate system

UniPeek's phone sends **normalised** coordinates where `(0, 0)` is the **top-left** of the screen. Unity's Input System uses **screen pixels** where `(0, 0)` is the **bottom-left**.

UniPeek applies the conversion automatically before injecting into the Input System:

```text
screenX = normalizedX × Screen.width
screenY = (1 − normalizedY) × Screen.height   // Y-flip
```

When reading via `UniPeekInput`, the coordinates are still in the raw normalised form (Y = 0 at top). Apply the same flip yourself when converting to screen or world space.

### Pinch-to-scale example

The finger-pair baseline must be reset whenever the tracked pair changes (e.g. a third finger joins, or one of the original two lifts while the other stays down).

```csharp
private float _prevPinchDist = -1f;
private int   _pinchId0 = -1, _pinchId1 = -1;

void Update()
{
    var touches = ETouch.activeTouches;

    ETouch t0 = default, t1 = default;
    int live = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < touches.Count && live < 2; i++)
    {
        var ph = touches[i].phase;
        if (ph == UnityEngine.InputSystem.TouchPhase.Ended ||
            ph == UnityEngine.InputSystem.TouchPhase.Canceled) continue;
        if (live == 0) t0 = touches[i]; else t1 = touches[i];
        live++;
    }

    if (live >= 2)
    {
        // Reset when the finger pair changes
        if (t0.touchId != _pinchId0 || t1.touchId != _pinchId1)
        {
            _prevPinchDist = -1f;
            _pinchId0 = t0.touchId;
            _pinchId1 = t1.touchId;
        }

        float dist = Vector2.Distance(t0.screenPosition, t1.screenPosition);
        if (_prevPinchDist > 0f)
        {
            float ratio = dist / _prevPinchDist;
            float s = Mathf.Clamp(transform.localScale.x * ratio, 0.1f, 5f);
            transform.localScale = Vector3.one * s;
        }
        _prevPinchDist = dist;
    }
    else
    {
        _prevPinchDist = -1f;
        _pinchId0 = _pinchId1 = -1;
    }
}
```

## Gyroscope and Accelerometer

The phone continuously sends gyroscope (rotation rate) and accelerometer (gravity + motion) data to Unity. These are **Pro** features. When `com.unity.inputsystem` is installed, they are injected as virtual sensor devices — your game code reads them as normal.

### Accelerometer

```csharp
// New Input System (required)
var accel = Accelerometer.current;
if (accel != null)
    Vector3 g = accel.acceleration.ReadValue();
```

### Gyroscope

```csharp
// New Input System — rotation rate via AttitudeSensor
var attitude = AttitudeSensor.current;
if (attitude != null)
    Quaternion rot = attitude.attitude.ReadValue();
```

> Legacy `Input.gyro` injection is not supported by Unity's public API. Use the new Input System for gyroscope data.

---

## Windows Firewall

On first launch, UniPeek asks for a one-time UAC (administrator) prompt to add a Windows Firewall rule allowing inbound connections on port **7777**. Without this, the phone cannot reach the editor.

If you declined the prompt or the rule was removed, click **Reset FW** in the toolbar and then **Start Streaming** again to re-run the setup.

If you prefer to add the rule manually, run this in an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "UniPeek" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 7777 -Profile Any
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| QR code shows `127.0.0.1` | Your machine has no active Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Connect to the network first. |
| Phone can't find the host via Browse | Both must be on the same subnet. Some guest/corporate Wi-Fi blocks device-to-device traffic — try the QR code or Reverse Connection mode instead. |
| Firewall prompt never appeared / connections fail | Click **Reset FW** in the toolbar, then **Start Streaming** again. |
| Stream is black or frozen | Make sure there is at least one camera tagged `MainCamera` in your scene. In Edit Mode, `Camera.main` must exist. |
| Touch events are not registering | Check **Edit → Project Settings → Player → Active Input Handling**. If using Legacy only, UniPeek injects via reflection (best-effort). For reliable injection, install `com.unity.inputsystem` and set Active Input Handling to **Input System Package** or **Both**. |
| Touch works but UI / Canvas buttons don't respond | Your Canvas is still using the old **Standalone Input Module**. Select the **EventSystem** in your scene and replace the Standalone Input Module component with **Input System UI Input Module** (`UnityEngine.InputSystem.UI.InputSystemUIInputModule`). |
| High latency or choppy video | Lower the quality setting in the app, switch to **Async GPU Readback**, or reduce resolution to 540p. |
| Stream drops on recompile | Disable **Run in Play Mode** to allow the stream to persist across domain reloads. |
| WebRTC mode not available | Install `com.unity.webrtc` ≥ 3.0.0. The Socket Mode dropdown will show the WebRTC option once the package is detected. |

---

## Default Ports

| Port | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **7777** | UniPeek WebSocket server (phone → editor, configurable) |
| **7778** | Reverse connection (editor → phone in Listen mode, fixed) |
